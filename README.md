# Zhang-Shasha_C-plus
Implementation of Zhangshasha algorithm with C++

When i first learn Zhang-Shasha algorithm，there is only implement with Java or Python on github and other website. The worst thing is that my project is compiled by C++,so I implemented the algorithm with C Plus(reference paper：Zhang-shasha_1989)
